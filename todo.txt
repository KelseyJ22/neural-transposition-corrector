TODOS
- rewrite RNN model with more sensical structure
	BASIC IDEA
	encoder placeholder = encoder_input.size
	decoder placeholder = decoder_input.size
	batches are of the form encoder_input, decoder_output
	want to have an encoder of multiRNNCell
	want to have a decoder using TF's fancy new decoder stuff
	need to learn the embeddings
		instantiate as trainable=True
		lookup all misspellings as UNK
		also convolve or recur over the characters in the word
