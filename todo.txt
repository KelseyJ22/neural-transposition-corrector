TODOS

1) download data
2) download embeddings
3) complete data read-in and preprocessing
4) complete embedding loading
5) decide where the eventual character-level stuff will go
6) begin debug of basic RNN
7) research fine-tuning encoder/decoder in TensorFlow (as opposed to seq2seq's built in)
8) figure out what's up with transposing of the batches
