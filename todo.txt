TODOS
- decide where the eventual character-level stuff will go
- research fine-tuning encoder/decoder in TensorFlow (as opposed to seq2seq's built in)
- figure out what's up with transposing of the batches
- for input parsing:
	- don't shuffle apostrophes
	- discard empty sentences
	- chop out empty strings from sentences
	- discard parentheses and dashes
